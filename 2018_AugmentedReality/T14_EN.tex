\begin{block}{Problem description} 
 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Teaching robotics is a challenge in many universities.   
\note[item]{\scriptsize The mathematics, electronics, electrical, control and mechanical concepts used in this area are hard to learn. Tools that facilitates the learning of this concepts are required}		
		\item A new technology for education is augmented reality (AR), that allows the co-existence of real and virtual objects in the same environment.  
\note[item]{\scriptsize In recent years, augmented reality has improved learning in several engineering areas}		
		\item AR can be combined with other techniques to enrich the applications, to
improve the teaching-learning process inside classrooms and laboratories.  
\note[item]{\scriptsize Areas that can be improved with AR are learning or robotics }
\item We propose a platform for teaching robotic arm manipulation concepts, having the following components: a homemade robotic arm, a control system, a desktop App and a Mobile App.   
\note[item]{\scriptsize  The home made robotic receives commands from the desktop app, moves each robotic arm articulation based on these commands. }
\item The mobile app uses AR to show the angles of the robotic arm articulations.  
\note[item]{\scriptsize The app allow the students to visualize in real time the response of the arm to the commands using AR.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The desktop application sends commands to the robotic arm control.  
\note[item]{\scriptsize Using a USB serial protocol.}
\item The robotic arm control moves the arm and sends back the angles of each articulation.  
%\note[item]{\scriptsize The robotic control generates the movement commands for each articulation, based on the information obtained from the desktop application.}
\item The mobile application sends a connection request to the robotic arm.   
\note[item]{\scriptsize The app uses a Bluetooth connection. } 
\item The mobile application identifies the markers located in the robot arm.  
%\note[item]{\scriptsize Once the connection is established, the mobile application identifies the markers located in the robot arm and sends a request to the robotic arm controller.}
\note[item]{\scriptsize Each robot articulation has a marker. In this specific case, we used only two markers, but this design can be extended to robotic arms with more than two articulations. }
